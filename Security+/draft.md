Chap 9 note
Various backup rotation schemes exist to ensure that data can be
restored and to allow backup media to be reused, but the
Security+ exam does not delve into backup rotation schemes.
Make sure you know the difference between full, incremental,
and differential backups, and why you might choose one over the
other. Remember, incremental captures the difference between
the last backup and the time it is taken, whereas differential
captures the difference between the last full backup and the time
it is taken. Make sure you also know what snapshots and images
are, and where those concepts are most commonly used.
If you haven't encountered backup rotation schemes, you can
learn a lot more by reading about FIFO, grandfather-father-son,
and the Tower of Hanoi schedules.
