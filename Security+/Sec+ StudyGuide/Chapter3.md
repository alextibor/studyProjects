## Chapter 3 - Malicious Code

Malware comes in many forms, from ransomware and remote access Trojans to Trojans, bots, and the command-and-control infrastructures that allow attackers to run entire networks of compromised systems.

## Malware

The term malware describes a wide range of software that is intentionally designed to cause harm to systems and devices, networks, or users. Malware can also gather information, provideillicit access, and take a broad range of actions that the legitimate owner of a system or network may not want to occur. The SY0-601 Security+ exam objectives include a number of the most common types of malware, and you will need to be familiar with each of them, how to tell them apart, how you can identify them, and common techniques used in combatting them.

## Ransomware

Ransomware is malware that takes over a computer and then demands a ransom. There are many types of ransomware, including crypto malware, which encrypts files and then holds them hostage until a ransom is paid. Other ransomware techniques include threatening to report the user to law enforcement due to pirated software or pornography, or threatening to expose sensitive information or pictures from the victim's hard drive or device.

One of the most important defenses against ransomware is an effective backup system that stores files in a separate location that will not be impacted if the system or device it backs up is infected and encrypted by ransomware. Organizations that are preparing to deal with ransomware need to determine what their response will be;

## Trojans

Trojans, or Trojan horses, are a type of malware that is typically disguised as legitimate software. They are called Trojan horses because they rely on unsuspecting individuals running them, thus providing attackers with a path into a system or device.
