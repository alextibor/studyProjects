## Chapter 1 - Today's Security Professional

Security professionals are responsible for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems used by their organizations.

## Cybersecurity Objectives

protecting sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure is certainly one element of a cybersecurity program, it is important to understand that cybersecurity actually has three complementary objectives, as shown in Figure 1.1.

Confidentiality ensures that unauthorized individuals are not able to gain access to sensitive information done by security controls, including firewalls, access control lists, and encryption, to prevent unauthorized access to information.

Integrity ensures that there are no unauthorized modifications to information or systems, either intentionally or unintentionally.

Availability ensures that information and systems are ready to meet the needs of legitimate users at the time those users request them.

Cybersecurity analysts often refer to these three goals, known as the CIA Triad, when performing their work.

## Data Breach Risks

Security incidents occur when an organization experiences a breach of the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of information or information systems. Security professionals are responsible for understanding these risks and implementing controls designed to manage those risks to an acceptable level. To do so, they must first understand the effects that a breach might have on the organization and the impact it might have on an ongoing basis.

## The DAD Triad

This model explains the three key threats to cybersecurity efforts: disclosure, alteration, and denial. Each of these three threats maps directly to one of the main goals of cybersecurity.

**Disclosure** is the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized individuals, otherwise known as data loss. Disclosure is a violation of the principle of confidentiality. Attackers who gain access to sensitive information and remove it from the organization are said to be performing data exfiltration. Disclosure may also occur accidentally, such as when an administrator misconfigures access controls or an employee loses a device.

**Alteration** is the unauthorized modification of information and is a violation of the principle of integrity. Attackers may seek to modify records contained in a system for financial gain, such as adding fraudulent transactions to a financial account. Alteration may occur as the result of natural activity, such as a power surge causing a “bit flip” that modifies stored data. Accidental alteration is also a possibility, if users unintentionally modify information stored in a critical system as the result of a typo or other unintended activity.

**Denial** is the unintended disruption of an authorized user's legitimate access to information. Denial events violate the principle of availability. This availability loss may be intentional, such as when an attacker launches a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against a website. Denial may also occur as the result of accidental activity, such as the failure of a critical server, or as the result of natural activity, such as a natural disaster impacting a communications circuit.

The CIA and DAD triads are very useful tools for cybersecurity planning and risk analysis.

The CIA and DAD triads are very useful tools for cybersecurity planning and risk analysis. Whenever you find yourself tasked with a broad goal of assessing the security controls used to protect an asset or the threats to an organization, you can turn to the CIA and DAD triads for guidance. For example, if you're asked to assess the threats to your organization's website, you may apply the DAD triad in your analysis:

Does the website contain sensitive information that would damage the organization if disclosed to unauthorized individuals?

If an attacker were able to modify information contained on the website, would this unauthorized alteration cause financial, reputational, or operational damage to the organization?

Does the website perform mission-critical activities that could damage the business significantly if an attacker were able to disrupt the site?

## Breach Impact

The impacts of a security incident may be wide-ranging, depending upon the nature of the incident and the type of organization affected. We can categorize the potential impact of a security incident using the same categories that businesses generally use to describe any type of risk: financial, reputational, strategic, operational, and compliance.

## Financial Risk

**Financial risk** is, as the name implies, the risk of monetary damage to the organization as the result of a data breach Financial risk may also be indirect and come as a second-order consequence of the breach. For example, if an employee loses a laptop containing plans for a new product, the organization suffers direct financial damage.

**Reputational Risk**

Reputational risk occurs when the negative publicity surrounding a security breach causes the loss of goodwill among customers, employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders.

## Identity Theft

The most common impact on a dameged organization is the risk of identity theft posed by the exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) to unscrupulous individuals.

## Strategic Risk

Strategic risk is the risk that an organization will become less effective in meeting its major goals and objectives as a result of the breach.

## Operational Risk

Operational risk is risk to the organization's ability to carry out its day-to-day functions.

Operational risk and strategic risk are closely related, so it might be difficult to distinguish between them.

## Compliance Risk

Compliance risk occurs when a security breach causes an organization to run afoul of legal or regulatory requirements. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires that health-care providers and other covered entities protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI). If an organization loses patient medical records, they violate HIPAA requirements and are subject to sanctions and fines from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That's an example of compliance risk.

Organizations face many different types of compliance risk in today's regulatory landscape.

## Risks Often Cross Categories

In most cases, a risk will cross multiple risk categories. For example, if an organization suffers a data breach that exposes customer PII to unknown individuals, the organization will likely suffer reputational damage due to negative media coverage. However, the organization may also suffer financial damage. Some of this financial damage may come in the form of lost business due to the reputational damage.

## Implementing Security Controls

Security controls are specific measures that fulfill the security objectives of an organization.

## Security Control Categories

Security controls are categorized based on their mechanism of action: the way that they achieve their objectives. There are three different categories of security control:

**Technical controls** enforce confidentiality, integrity, and availability in the digital space. Examples of technical security controls include firewall rules, access control lists, intrusion prevention systems, and encryption.

**Operational controls** include the processes that we put in place to manage technology in a secure manner. These include user access reviews, log monitoring, and vulnerability management.

**Managerial controls** are procedural mechanisms that focus on the mechanics of the risk management process. Examples of
administrative controls include periodic risk assessments, security planning exercises, and the incorporation of security into the organization's change management, service acquisition, and project management practices.
