## Cybersecurity Threat Landscape

Cybersecurity threats have become increasingly sophisticated and diverse over the past three decades.

An environment that was once populated by lone hobbyists is now shared by skilled technologists organized criminal syndicates, and even government-sponsored attackers, all seeking to exploit the digital domain to achieve their own objectives.

You will learn how to build your own organization's threat intelligence capability to stay current as the threat environment evolves.

## Exploring Cybersecurity Threats

Cybersecurity threat actors differ significantly in their skills, capabilities, resources, and motivation.

## Classifying Cybersecurity Threats

Let's examine the characteristics that differentiate the types of cybersecurity threat actors Understanding our adversary is crucial to defending against them.

**Internal vs. External** We most often think about the threat actors who exist outside our organizations: competitors, criminals, and the curious. However, some of the most dangerous threats come from within our own environments. We'll discuss the insider threat later in this chapter.

**Level of Sophistication/Capability** Threat actors vary greatly in their level of cybersecurity sophistication and capability. As we explore different types of threat actors in this chapter, we'll discuss how they range from the unsophisticated script kiddie simply running code borrowed from others to the advanced persistent threat (APT) actor exploiting vulnerabilities discovered in their own research labs and unknown to the security community.

**Resources/Funding** Just as threat actors vary in their sophistication, they also vary in the resources available to them. Highly organized attackers sponsored by criminal syndicates or national governments often have virtually limitless resources, whereas less organized attackers may simply be hobbyists working in their spare time.

**Intent/Motivation** Attackers also vary in their motivation and intent. The script kiddie may be simply out for the thrill of the attack, whereas competitors may be engaged in highly targeted corporate espionage. Nation-states seek to achieve political objectives; criminal syndicates often focus on direct financial gain.

As we work through this chapter, we'll explore different types of threat actors. As we do so, take some time to reflect back on these characteristics. In addition, you may wish to reference them when you hear news of current cybersecurity attacks in the media and other sources. Dissect those stories and analyze the threat actors involved. If the attack came from an unknown source, think about the characteristics that are most likely associated with the attacker. These can be important clues during a cybersecurity investigation. For example, a ransomware attack seeking payment from the victim is more likely associated with a criminal syndicate seeking financial gain than a competitor engaged in corporate espionage.

**Threat Actors**

We can use to discuss the different types of threat actors, let's explore the most common types.

**Script Kiddies**

The term script kiddie is a derogatory term for people who use hacking techniques but have limited skills. Often such attackers may rely almost entirely on automated tools they download from the Internet. These attackers often have little knowledge of how their attacks actually work, and they are simply seeking out convenient targets of opportunity. Because they use simple, free or paid tools, script kids pose a great threat. Script kiddies are plentiful and unfocused in their work. They are much less discriminating in their target selection. In general, the motivations of script kiddies revolve around trying to prove their skill.

Fortunately, the number of script kiddies is often offset by their lack of skill and lack of resources. These individuals tend to be rather young, they work alone, and they have very few resources. And by resources, we mean time as well as money. A script kiddie normally can't attack your network 24 hours a day. They usually have to work a job, go to school, and attend to other life functions.

**Hacktivists**

Hacktivists use hacking techniques to accomplish some activist goal. They might deface the website of a company whose policies they disagree with. Or a hacktivist might attack a network due to some political issue. The defining characteristic of hacktivists is that they believe they are motivated by the greater good, even if their activity violates the law.

Their activist motivation means that measures that might deter other attackers will be less likely to deter a hacktivist. Because they believe that they are engaged in a just crusade, they will, at least in some instances, risk getting caught to accomplish their goals. They may even view being caught as a badge of honor and a sacrifice for their cause.

The skill levels of hacktivists vary widely. Some are only script kiddies, whereas others are quite skilled, having honed their craft over the years. In fact, some cybersecurity researchers believe that some hacktivists are actually employed as cybersecurity professionals as their “day job” and perform hacktivist attacks in their spare time. Highly skilled hacktivists pose a significant danger to their targets.

The resources of hacktivists also vary somewhat. Many are working alone and have very limited resources. However, some are part of organized efforts. The hacking group Anonymous, who uses the logo seen in Figure 2.1, is the most well-known hacktivist group. They collectively decide their agenda and their targets. Over the years, Anonymous has waged cyberattacks against targets as diverse as the Church of Scientology, PayPal, Visa and Mastercard, Westboro Baptist Church, and even government agencies.

This type of anonymous collective of attackers can prove quite powerful. Large groups will always have more time and other resources than a lone attacker. Due to their distributed and anonymous nature, it is difficult to identify, investigate, and prosecute participants in their hacking activities. The group lacks a hierarchical structure, and the capture of one member is unlikely to compromise the identities of other members.

## Criminal Syndicates

Organized crime appears in any case where there is money to be made, and cybercrime is no exception. The ranks of cybercriminals include links to traditional organized crime families in the United States, outlaw gangs, the Russian Mafia, and even criminal groups organized specifically for the purpose of engaging in cybercrime.

The common thread among these groups is motive and intent. The motive is simply illegal financial gain. Organized criminal syndicates do not normally embrace political issues or causes, and they are not trying to demonstrate their skills. In fact, they would often prefer to remain in the shadows, drawing as little attention to themselves as possible. They simply want to generate as much illegal profit as they possibly can.

In their 2019 Internet Organized Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA), the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (EUROPOL) found that organized crime groups were active in a variety of cybercrime categories, including the following:

**Cyber-dependent crime**, including ransomware, data compromise, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, website defacement, and attacks against critical infrastructure.

**Child sexual exploitation**, including child pornography, abuse, and solicitation.

**Payment fraud**, including credit card fraud and business email compromises.

**Dark web** activity, including the sale of illegal goods and services.

**Terrorism** support, including facilitating the actions of terrorist groups online.

**Cross-cutting crime factors**, including social engineering, money mules, and the criminal abuse of cryptocurrencies.

Organized crime tends to have attackers who range from moderately skilled to highly skilled. **It is rare for script kiddies to be involved in these crimes, and if they are, they tend to be caught rather quickly.** The other defining factor is that organized crime groups tend to have more resources, both in terms of time and money, than do hacktivists or script kiddies. They often embrace the idea that “it takes money to make money” and are willing to invest in their criminal enterprises in the hopes of yielding a significant return on their investments.
