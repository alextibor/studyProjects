## Social Engineering, Physical, and Password Attacks

Social engineering techniques focus on the human side of information security. Using social engineering techniques, security professionals and attackers can accomplish a variety of tasks ranging from acquiring information to gaining access to buildings, systems, and networks.



## Social Engineering

Social engineering is the practice of manipulating people through a variety of strategies to accomplish desired actions. Social engineers work to influence their targets to take actions that they might not otherwise have taken.

Seven key principles are leveraged to successfully social engineer an individualand though the list of principles and their names vary depending on the source you read, the Security+ exam focuses on:

**Authority**, which relies on the fact that most people will obey someone who appears to be in charge or knowledgeable, regardless of whether or not they actually are. A social engineer using the principle of authority may claim to be a manager, a government official, or some other person who would have authority in the situation they are operating in.

**Intimidation** relies on scaring or bullying an individual into taking a desired action. The individual who is targeted will feel threatened and respond by doing what the social engineer wants them to do.

**Consensus**-based social engineering uses the fact that people tend to want to do what others are doing to persuade them to take an action. A consensus-based social engineering attack might point out that everyone else in a department had already clicked on a link, or might provide fake testimonials about a product making it look safe. Consensus is called “social proof” in some categorization schemes.

**Scarcity** is used for social engineering in scenarios that make something look more desirable because it may be the last one available.

**Familiarity**-based attacks rely on you liking the individual or even the organization the individual is claiming to represent.

**Trust**, much like familiarity, relies on a connection with the individual they are targeting. Unlike with familiarity, which relies on targets thinking that something is normal and thus familiar, social engineers who use this technique work to build a connection with their targets so that they will take the actions that they want them to take.

**Urgency** relies on creating a feeling that the action must be taken quickly due to some reason or reasons.
