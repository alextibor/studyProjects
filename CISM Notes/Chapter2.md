# Information Security Governance

In this chapter, you will learn about

- ISACA defines this domain as follows: “Establish and/or maintain an information security governance framework and supporting processes to ensure that the information security strategy is aligned with organizational goals and objectives.”

These are some of the activities required to protect the organization:

- Risk management
- Process improvement
- Event identification
- Incident response
- Improved compliance
- Business continuity and disaster recovery planning
- Metrics
- Resource management
- Improved IT governance

# Business Alignment

An organization’s information security program needs to fit into the rest of the organization.

- Mission
- Goals and objectives
- Strategy

To be business aligned, people in the security program should be aware of several characteristics about the organization, including the following:

- Culture
- Asset value
- Risk tolerance
- Legal obligations

# Goals and Objectives

Goals and objectives are typically statements in the form of imperatives that describe the development or improvement of business capabilities.

# Risk Appetite

Each organization has a particular appetite for risk, although few have documented that appetite.

Risk capacity is related to risk appetite. ISACA defines risk capacity as the objective amount of loss that an organization can tolerate without its continued existence being called intoquestion.

# Roles and Responsibilities

Information security governance is most effective when every person in the organization knows what is expected of them. Better organizations develop formal roles and responsibilities so that personnel will have a clearer idea of their part in all matters related to the protection of systems, information, and even themselves.

# Executive Management

Executive management is responsible for carrying out directives issued by the board of directors. In the context of information security management, this includes ensuring that there are sufficient resources for the organization to implement a security program and to develop and maintain security controls to protect critical assets.
