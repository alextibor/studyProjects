            <h2>SAMUEL L. IPSUM</h2>
                <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li class="itens">The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.</li>
                    <li class="itens">Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you.</li>
                    <li class="itens">Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami.</li>
